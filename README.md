nxdk - *the new open source xdk*
================================
nxdk is a software development kit for the original Xbox. nxdk is a revitalization of [OpenXDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20170624051336/http://openxdk.sourceforge.net:80/).
It is maintained by the [XboxDev](https://github.com/XboxDev/XboxDev) community.

Notable features:
- Portable toolchain that works on modern versions of Windows, macOS and Linux.
- No complicated cross-compiling or big library dependencies! Builds with `make` and just needs standard tools and llvm.
- Modern C / C++ standards and compiler features.
- Supports popular APIs like Windows API and BSD sockets.
- SDL2 support for input, audio and 2D graphics.
- Custom API for 3D graphics using NVIDIA-designed shader-languages (with additional Xbox extensions).
- Open-Source drivers which can be modified to get the most out of the hardware.
- Modifiable startup code, for as much system control as necessary.
- Supported by an active community that can help with problems and responds to bug reports.

Build Status
------
![CI Status for "Build Samples"](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/actions/workflows/build_samples.yml/badge.svg)

Status
------
While nxdk still is in early stages of development, it can already be used in many projects.
Take a look at the [list of projects](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Projects-using-nxdk) that are build on top of nxdk. Additionally, the [provided samples](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/tree/master/samples) show how to use common features.

Getting Started
---------------
### Prerequisites
You will need the following tools:
- GNU make
- [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/)
- [GNU bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/)
- [lld](http://lld.llvm.org/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

OS-specific instructions for installing these prerequisites can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Install-the-Prerequisites)

### Download nxdk
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk.git

### Build Samples
Samples are easily built by running the activation script `bin/activate`, which will spawn a shell that is fully set up to start using nxdk, and then running the Makefile in one of the sample directories. Details can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Build-a-Sample). nxdk also supports automatic [creation of ISO files](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk/wiki/Create-an-XISO).

Next Steps
----------
Copy one of the sample directories to get started. You can copy it anywhere you like. Run nxdk's activation script `bin/activate`, then, in the directory of your program, you can simply run `make`.
